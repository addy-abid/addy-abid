### Hello i'm AdnanðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Adnan Abid and I am a software engineer with a passion for fixing things! I know JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express and more!

I love asking questions and breaking things down to learn how they work. 

With a background in finance, I learned there was only so much you can do while still adhereing to regulations which is why coding has been so great: there are endless posibilities! 

I have a strong interest in servers and back-end development and plan on learning so more technologies in that area.

When i'm not coding, you can find me producing music or at the dog park!
